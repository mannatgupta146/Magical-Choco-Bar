## How It Works  

1. **Visual Feast**  
   - Rendered using layered CSS gradients  
   - 3D effect created with `transform: rotateX/rotateZ`  

2. **Hover Magic**  
   - Subtle elevation with `transform: translateY`  
   - Smooth transition using `cubic-bezier` timing  

3. **Bite Effect**  
   - Dynamic clip-path manipulation on click  
   - Particle explosion using box-shadow trickery  
   - Physics-based animation with `@keyframes`  

4. **Reset Mechanism**  
   - Automatic state restoration after animation  
   - Position tracking via CSS custom properties 
  

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and animations  
- **Google Fonts** for typography  

## Customization  

- Modify colors in `style.css` using CSS variables (`--brown`, `--brown-dark`, etc.).  
- Adjust animation speed and effects in `@keyframes`.  
- Change font styles in `font-family`.  

## Future Enhancements  

- Add a melting effect on hover.  
- Introduce sound effects when clicked.  
- Enable different bite sizes for variation.
